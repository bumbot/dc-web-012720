Come up with at least one question to ask about Sinatra:

<!-- - gem installation--does Rack get installed
- how does sinatra use Rack -->

- method override, i.e., why does Sinatra hate me
- delete form - tricking with a post
- tips for debugging
<!-- - rake db:migrate vs rake db:migrate SINATRA_ENV=production
 -->
<!-- TBD - yield -->
- splitting files--how do multiple controllers relate to multiple views
- form tag with different types of inputs for same value
<!-- - routing with controller/views -->
<!-- - difference between patch and put -->
- nested attributes in form params
<!-- - why would we use Sinatra at all?  -->
