## Intro: What is Rails 

Show this video [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ML8PrP3A8E) of a Sinatra app being built to remind students of where they have been this week and highlight the problems that Rails is solving for them.

So, this is where rails comes into play. Rails was created with the goal to gt rid of alot this repetition In short, with Rails you can get started with a full-stack web application by quickly creating pages and templates. This allows us (programmers) to only be focused on what really matters in our application. We no longer have to worry about setting our environment, getting all the files connected which saves us alot of time and repetition.

Rails heavily emphasizes ***"Convention over Configuration."*** This means that a programmer only needs to specify and code out the non-standard parts of a program. Even though Rails comes with its own set of tools and settings, you're certainly not limited to library of rails commands and configurations. Developers are free to configure their applications however they wish, though adopting conventions is certainly recommended.

#### A Look Back

Rails was created in 2003 by David Heinemeier Hansson. 
In 2004 Rails become open source and overtime its gone through alot of iterations throughout the years but despite all the changes, Rails has always kept to the **three basic principes**

**- Following the Ruby Programming Language**

**- Following the Model-View-Controller convention**

**- Programmer Happiness**

* Rails 1.0 (Dec 2005) - Mostly polishing up and closing pending tickets from the first release along with the inclusion of Scriptaculous 1.5 and Prototype 1.4.
* Rails 1.2 (Jan 2007) - REST and generation HTTP appreciation
* Rails 2.0 (Dec 2007) - Better routing resources, multi-view, HTTP basic authentication, cookie store sessions
* Rails 2.0 (Nov 2008) - i18n, thread safe, connection pool, Ruby 1.9, JRuby
* Rails 2.3 (Mar 2009) - Templates, Engines, Rack
* Rails 3.0 (Aug 2010) - New query engine, new router for controller, mailer controller, CRSF protection
* Rails 3.1 (Aug 2011) - jQuery, SASS, CoffeeScript, Sprockets with Assets Pipeline
* Rails 3.2 (Jan 2012) - Journey routing engine, faster development mode, automatic query explains, tagged loggin for multi-user application
* Rails 4.0 (June 2013) -  Rails 4.2: Active Job, Asynchronous Mails, Adequate Record, Web Console, Foreign Keys.
* Rails 5.0 (June 2016) - Notable additions in Rails 5.0 include an option for an API-only application suitable for use as a backend to JavaScript or mobile applications. Also Action Cable for live features such as chat and notifications.


Over the years, Rails has indeed made it easier for beginners to dive into web development and build large complex applications. Some popular websites built on Rails include Twitter (at one point), GitHub and, of course, 37signals' very own Basecamp. Although it has often been criticized for performance and bloat, Rails continues its iterations with an ever-growing developer community and a vibrant ecosystem.

## Codealong: Installing Rails

#### Let's install rails

```bash
  gem install rails
```

Versions of Rails change quite rapidly, and if you leave off the "-v", you'll just get the latest version. Be specific if you want a specific version.

```bash
  gem install rails -v=INSERT_RAILS_VERSION_HERE
```

## Codealong: Creating a Rails App

#### Create a rails app

For this introduction, we want to create a simple app: a petstore! The specs for this app are as follows:

* Display a list of all pets
* Create new pets and edit existing pets

Rails follow a pattern called **"convention over configuration"** - this means that by default, a Rails app expects you to follow specific patterns and folder structures. This means you need to learn these conventions, but also means that once you learn them, you save time by not having to setup a lot of the configuration you'd otherwise need to set up manually.

This structure may look a bit complex – there a lot of files, specific naming conventions, and some nested files and folders. We generally don't create this structure manually, but instead use the Rails command line tool, which initializes the app for us:

```bash
  rails new petstore
```

> **Note:** By default, if you *do not* add any option for the database, Rails will create the app with SQLite3. While you are working in a local development environment (localhost), you won't notice much of a difference between SQLite3 and PostgreSQL.

> Once your app is in production on a remote server, you will *not* use SQLite, and they will often use PostgreSQL. A best practice in web development is to keep development and production environments as similar as possible, so we recommend using PostgreSQL from the start.

Now, let's go into the petstore folder:

```bash
  cd petstore
```

Let's look at the contents of this folder (using `ls`), and take a look at the files and folders that were magically created by the `rails new` command:

```
├── app
├── bin
├── config
├── db
├── lib
├── log
├── public
├── test
├── tmp
└── vendor
```

Some details about this structure:

* 90% of the web app code will be inside the folder `app`, including all of our model, view, and controller logic.
* `config` contains all the credentials for the DB and other 3rd party services, all the deployment settings, and the specs about how to serve this app over HTTP.
* `db` will contain all of your migrations

We will describe the other folders in later lessons, and for the next couple of weeks, you will primarily write code inside the folders described above.


## Generators

A primary goal of the Rails team was to make it efficient to build core application functionality. The Rails system has a number of generators that will do some of the manual work for us.

#### Generate a model

Sometimes, you will need a model but not the related controller, in this case, you will use the model generator:

```
rails g model MODEL_NAME [fields]
```

This will generate the model by itself along with the migration containing all the fields and the data types if you wrote them when you typed the console.

#### Generate a migration

In Sinatra you had to create your migrations by hand. As with most things in Rails, theres an generator for that.

```ruby
rails g migration AddAgeToPets age:integer
```

By following certain conventions like the one above, rails will generate a migration that specifically adds the age column to your existing pets column.

```ruby
class AddAgeToPet < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    add_column :pets, :age, :integer
  end
end
```

#### Generate a controller

As Rails is an MVC framework, we will need to have controllers to handle requests and call the database through models.

In Rails, the controllers are files inside the folder `app/controllers`. If you open this folder, you will see that one controller is already here: the file `application_controller.rb`. This controller does not directly handle HTTP requests, but rather serves as a link between all the controllers we will create, `application_controller.rb` will be the parent of all the controllers in our app.

There is 3 different ways for creating a controller in Rails:

1. We can manually create a file and write the ruby code inside it.
2. We can use a generator called `controller`, using `rails g controller CONTROLLER_NAME [ACTIONS]`. For instance, if we want to create a controller for the resource `pets` with an action and a view for `index` and `show`, we would type in the console `rails g controller pets index show`. This command would create a bunch of files and modify some others:

   * The controller itself, `pets_controller.rb` inside `app/controllers`
   * The views for each method , in this case
     * `app/views/index.html.erb`
     * `app/views/show.html.erb`
   * The routes handlers for these two actions will also be added to config/routes.rb :
     * `get '/pets/index', to: 'pets#index'`
     * `get '/pets/show', to: 'pets#show'`
   
    * Inside the controller we specify the action method
  	```
	def index
	  @pets = Pet.all
          render 'index'
	end 
        ```
	
#### Create methods for a RESTful controller

We've already defined what a RESTful resource is, let's see how to implement it in a rails app.

As a reminder, a RESTful resource will include 7 methods:

* Index
* Show
* New
* Create
* Edit
* Update
* Delete

#### Implicit vs Explicit Rendering


Thanks to Rails conventions, we do not need to specify the view file to render in our controller. This is known as implicit rendering

In app/controllers/pets

```ruby
  def index
  end

```

However, if we wanted to be more explicit or if we wanted to rendr a view template that does not correspond with the action name we could do the following:

```ruby
  def index
    render 'cats'
    # This will render cats.html.erb
  end

```

#### Create Views

There is no specific generator that will create only a view file, but you can add them manually into the appropriate folder inside views.

For instance, if we want to add a view file `about` for the resource `Pet`, we can create a file `about.html.erb` in `app/views/pets`.

If a view is "static" - as in, it doesn't use any instance variables created in the controller - you can just create a route for this view and rails will render it in the browser even if there is no method in the controller:

In config/routes.rb

```ruby
get "/pets/about", to: 'pets#about'
```

If there is a file `about.html.erb` in `app/views/pets`, this file will be automatically rendered when you call `localhost:3000/pets/about`


#### Rails Routing vs. Sinatra Routing

As you know, a "route" is a combination of **the path** that was requested and **the HTTP verb** that was used to request that path.

```

                                          -----> Model <----> DB
                                         |         |
            response        request      |         |
   Browser <-------- router -------> controller <--
                             GET         ^
                             PUT         |
                             POST         -----> view <----> html/images/css/js
                             DELETE

```

When we've used Sinatra, we were managing the routes and the code executed for a specific route in the same place:


```ruby
	get "/pets" do
		# Here is the code that will be executed when the client requests /books
	end
```

This is handy for us as developers, because it allows us to keep everything in the same place - routing and controller logic - but if the app grows it can get unreadable. Imagine, for example, an app that has 20 or 30 different routes... your main routes file could contain a lot of complex code.

Rails has a "routing engine" that separates the routing logic from the controller logic (what we want to happen when routes are requested). The configuration for this routing engine is in the file `config/routes.rb`.

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do

end
```

Everything between the `do` and the `end` will be code related to handling routes for the current application.

Later on in this lesson, we will add some content in this file, and  in a later lesson, we will go into detail about handling routes inside a Rails application.


#### Scaffold

Rails has a generator called `scaffold` that will create the whole MVC structure for a resource, let's say that inside the petstore app, we want the `Owner` resource to have a name and a age field, we would type:

```ruby

rails g scaffold Owner name:string age:integer

```

Running this command will generate a lot of files, including the controller, the views, the model, and the migration. It will also update the routes file.

Take a look at the controller, it has all the RESTful methods, and these methods already contain the code to query the database through the model `Owner`.

We don't want all the files created with the scaffold and in practice you won't actually use it so let's delete it

```ruby

rails d scaffold Owner

```

#### Conclusion

Rome wasn't built in a day and neither can someone learn Rails in a day. Keep coding and it will all come together.
